/**
 * Fuel systems that use conventional oxygen sensor display the commanded open
 * loop equivalence ratio while the system is in open loop. Should report 100%
 * when in closed loop fuel.
 * <p>
 * To obtain the actual air/fuel ratio being commanded, multiply the
 * stoichiometric A/F ratio by the equivalence ratio. For example, gasoline,
 * stoichiometric is 14.64:1 ratio. If the fuel control system was commanded an
 * equivalence ratio of 0.95, the commanded A/F ratio to the engine would be
 * 14.64 * 0.95 = 13.9 A/F.
